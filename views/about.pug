        .portfolio-bio
          p I'm Diego Bolsoni from Brazil and I'm 32 years old, studied information systems from 19 to 22 years then changed to filmmaker studies. I like sports, games and movies. I worked in big companies since then as Rede Globo Television (the second bigger television world company) and at Light (distribution, generation, and commercialization of energy in Rio de Janeiro). So I know the issues and needs of the client's eyes. I'm interested at new clients/partners with good ideas and the most important, with the passion needed in doing new extraordinary things. In counterpart I offer to you my dedication in time and effort, new ways to solve your problems, originality in developing your product, and respect the schedule and budget. Let's build something extraordinary together. Contact me!
